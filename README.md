# Welcome to Game Crystal Collector Repository

## About This Project
Simple and fun game. "Numbers to match" in blue
" you have to collect the number in the green "Score" section. The cute icons below each represent a number and the more you click, the score increases. Good luck.
It is a very interesting and fun experience for me.
As I gain knowledge and experience, I enjoy writing code immensely
